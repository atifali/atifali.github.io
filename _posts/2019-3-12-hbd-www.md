Today is the 30 year mark since the first proposal for what became the world wide web (aka. "The Internet"), as we know it today. Just like a human being during its life span, the web has been through its own ups and downs, but I think it would be hard to argue against the notion that the web is going down in the history books as one of the mankind's greatest<!-- more --> achievements. 

Looking back to all the progress that has been made _'online'_, it makes me realize that we are such a lucky generation to be living in the early days of a __true global community__. The web has amplified the rate of __progress in our communities__ and has played a pivotal role in major __social, financial and cultural shifts__ across the globe. It has brought us closer together and has made __cheap access to technology__ a reality. And this progress does not seem to be slowing down at all, rather I would argue that it is growing at an almost exponential scale.

Sir Tim's original proposal which ironically was regarded as 'vague but exciting' by his boss, turned out to be today's 'Internet'.

However, just like most other technologies the web has had its fair share of unintended and/or undesirable consequences. From the rising number of online scamming and hacking incidents to the proliferation of fake news and viral mis-information campaigns, it is clearly evident that the web is no where near perfect (and it might never be). However, I believe it is in the spirit of greater good for humanity, that we as a global community need to tackle these shortcomings together with the best of our intentions in the coming years.

I personally think that as of today, the web needs __a shift within its incentive mechanisms__ so as to make sure that businesses online do not sacrifice the basic human rights of _privacy and freedom_ for their own short-term profits. This might mean overhauling the current business models and revenues streams that are prevalent today. This might also lead to breaking up and democratizing the _'soft infrastructure'_ that supports the web today in the coming years too. Another goal that needs to be addressed is that of __open and uncensored global access to the web__ for all. Almost half the world is online today and I think we need to make sure that the rest of the half has the same sort of opportunity for access to this piece of technology. On top of that we need to make sure that _censorship and malicious intent_, either from the governments, companies or other groups/individuals, is tackled properly. Finally, I think we as community need to __redesign the way we interact online__, since most of the _unpleasant and undesired discourses/incidents_ in online communities tend to be favored by the way our current interactions are orchestrated from a systems design perspective. As a whole I think we need to __incentivize a more inclusive, responsible and equal approach__ to how the web progresses further.   

I understand that there might not be clear cut answers here but humans have a good track record when it comes to agreeing on fundamental issues in the face of extreme crisis. And in the same spirit, the __World Wide Web Foundation__ is currently leading the charge with a **[Contract for the Web](https://contractfortheweb.org/)**, which is aimed at being _"the guiding star for the way forward as we move towards a more mature, responsible and inclusive future on the web"_.

I encourage you to go through **[Sir Tim's message](https://webfoundation.org/2019/03/web-birthday-30/)** for the web on this milestone today. Also check out the current outline of the _Contract for the Web_ and do add your support __#ForTheWeb__!!
