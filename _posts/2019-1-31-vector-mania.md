A couple days back I had one of those moments where you intuitively have a feeling (aka dem gut feelz) about something being right or wrong in terms of making mathematical sense, and then you go out on a limb to see if you can come up with a generalized model for the situation and see if it can be formed into a framework for the future, or<!-- more --> maybe there already is a framework that supports that generalization that you have somehow managed to learn before. In the former case, you simply come up with a brand new framework of thinking (that's where mostly theories come from), while in the latter case you simply reinforce the framework that already exists, by adding in one more scenario to strengthen the case. This time was the case of the latter, as I realized pretty early down my curiosity path. But I continued on and eventually reconciled my 'framework' with my 'intuition'.

At the end, I thought that the whirlwind of ideas that I generated were quite amusing, so I am going to share some of them here. Following was the issue at hand:

I had a very simple case of a static equilibrium problem at hand with a mechanical linkage system as shown below in Figure 1.

TO DO: Add Figure 1

In order to solve the equilibrium problem in this scenario, one would need to make sure that the force and moments about any point in the body are zero. Here I choose that point to be 'O'. Now when doing the moment calculation for the force 'F' about point 'O', there are actually a couple straight-forward ways (based on our knowledge of points in space) of doing it. You could take the cross product of
