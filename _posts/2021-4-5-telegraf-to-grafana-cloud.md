title: Visualizing IIoT data with the Telegraf plugins & Grafana Cloud Hosted Prometheus service
---

One of the biggest challenges with data visualization for complicated software systems is getting quick access to the underlying data and connecting it to some form of cloud-hosted solution. Traditionally it has required quite a bit of middleware and upfront setup with additional tooling. But with the advent of Grafana Cloud and the wider open source tooling infrastructures such as Telegraf, it is <!-- more -->much easier to siphon off data from complicated and highly specialized systems and into battle-tested, open source metric and visualization tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. And thereâ€™s the added benefit of low-cost and flexible long-term data storage.
