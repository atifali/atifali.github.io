title: Yet another blog!
---

Going from static webpages to hubpages and neocities, then to blogger and wordpress, and then doing a full circle back to somewhat static pages, I have been blogging on and off on the web since I was in school. I think its fair to say that recently I have not<!-- more --> been very consistent with posting my thoughts and work online. This is yet another attempt at blogging, considering my recent realization that it makes me think and reflect better on my daily train of thoughts and work. Hence, my goal here is to make sure that I post atleast something every week. Whether it be a page long post on some recent hack that I discovered, or a few lines worth of rant regarding a recent issue that I have discovered around me, the goal is to simply project some of my thoughts and ideas onto this blog and hopefully help other people in the process too. So lets begin...
