I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi" target="_blank">کراچی، پاکستان</a> (aka روشنیوں کا شہر - "City of Lights", except for the loadshedding hours). I went to the <a href="https://www.agakhanschools.org/Pakistan/SMS/Index" target="_blank">سلطان محمد شاہ آغا خان سکول</a> for most of my elementary school and then transferred to the <a href="https://www.beaconhouse.net/" target="_blank">بیکن ہاؤس اسکول</a> where I finished my high school diploma. In 2013, I moved to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yrne0UhRRg&ab_channel=DestinationVancouver" target="_blank">Vancouver, Canada</a> and enrolled in the <a href="https://mech.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a> program at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">UBC</a>. In 2015, I was part of the Octahedronli (aka <a href="https://youtu.be/n_6p-1J551Y" target="_blank">Cubli</a> 2.0) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYY9q-vs4Nw" target="_blank">Flying Platform</a> project at <a href="https://idsc.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">Institut für Dynamische Systeme und Regelungstechnik, ETH Zürich</a>. Summer 2016, I had a fling with the <a href="https://robots.ieee.org/robots/pr2/" target="_blank">PR2</a> at <a href="https://caris.mech.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">CARIS-UBC</a>, while working on the HMI Project. During most of 2017, I helped out <a href="https://www.natelenergy.com/" target="_blank">Natel</a> develop their controls platform. I graduated in 2018 with a specialization in Mechatronics. Since then I have helped the engineering team at <a href="https://www.bmt.org/" target="_blank">BMT</a> with giving analytical superpowers (JK - just payload detection and terrain vision) to heavy mining machinery. I was then briefly part of the early engineering team at a cybersecurity startup <a href="https://www.virgilsystems.com/" target="_blank">Systèmes Virgile</a> where I helped prototype their proprietary p2p data integrity network. After that I spent some time hacking away with the folks at <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>. I briefly also served on some of the faculty boards at the <a href="https://www.e-zigurat.com/en/" target="_blank">Instituto Global de Tecnología Zigurat</a>, right on the edge of the Iberian peninsula in <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona" target="_blank">Barcelona, ​​España</a>. I was also actively involved in the growing early-stage technology ecosystem, helping founders and startups across the globe, by contributing to communities such as the <a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/" target="_blank">Hustle Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" target="_blank">OnDeck</a>. I like to program, design, hack and break systems, well and I like blogging about such instances too. I like writing and am a big fan of poetry.
