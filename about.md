I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi" target="_blank">Karachi, Pakistan</a> (aka "City of Lights", except for the loadshedding hours). I went to the SMS School for most of the elemetary school and then transferred to the Beaconhouse School where I finished my high schoool diploma. In 2013 I moved to Vancouver, Canada (where I am currently based-for now) and enrolled in the Mechanical Engineering program at UBC. In 2015 I was part of the Octahedronli (aka <a href="https://youtu.be/n_6p-1J551Y" target="_blank">Cubli</a> 2.0) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYY9q-vs4Nw" target="_blank">Flying Platform</a> project at IDSC ETH-Z. Summer 2016, I had a fling with the <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/pr2/overview" target="_blank">PR2</a> at CARIS-UBC, while working on the HMI Project. During most of 2017 I helped out <a href="https://www.natelenergy.com/" target="_blank">Natel</a> develop their controls platform. I graduated in 2018 with a specialization in Mechatronics. I like to program, design, hack and break systems, well and I like blogging about such instances too. I like writing and am a big fan poems.
